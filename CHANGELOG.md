# CHANGELOG

## v1.5.0 (2023-SEP-30)
* differences from [previous tag](/../../compare/v1.4.7-1â€¦v1.5.0).
* *bme_env* at project's root always loaded, not only current dir's.
* CHANGELOG added.
* `make install` *"remembers"* where it was deployed so `make uninstall` can do the proper thing.

## Changelog started on version 1.5.0
